  Many people always ask me how I was able to get into Harvard as a 16 year old
  who skipped 3 grades of high school. They think I got in because of my scholarly
  records, but no the key is the interview. As I sat in the Harvard Dean's
  office in front of the board of reviewers for my application, the Dean
  asks me "Why should you be a good candidate for this school?" They seemed bored
  but I replied "Well I was born a child prodigy, placed 1st in my state spelling
  bee for three consecutive years, I can speak eight different languages not
  counting Latin. I guess you can say I'm pretty smart. :)

  Hey, Vsauce, Michael here! Down here. But which way is down? And how much
  does down weigh? Well, down weighs about 1/100 of a g/cm3 .  It is light, and
  airy, which makes it a great source of insulation and buoyancy for waterbirds.
  But if you let go of down, it falls down. So that's which way down is, it's
  the direction that gravity is pulling everything. Now for someone on the other
  side of the Earth, my down is their up, but where are falling things going? Why
  do things fall? Are they being pushed or pulled? Or, is it because of TIME  TRAVEL.

  So I was in my 99 Civic cruising on the highway and out of the corner of my
  eye I saw a little red thing. The red thing turned out to be a Ferrari and
  behind it was a Corvette ZR1, a Mclaren P1, and a Bugatti Chiron the four of
  them driving to what I assumed was the grocery store in their slow pathetic
  grocery getters. I looked over and the Ferrari driver gave me the look. The
  "You wanna do it" look, but not that kind of "You wanna do it", of course
  not, the kind of look of "hey you wanna race mate" which was street racing.
  That's the look he gave me, so I did what any rational sane man would do and
  floored the accelerator to to the powerful 1.6l single overhead cam D16Y7
  powerhouse. I felt my brain slam into the back of my skull as my Honda Civic
  racecar accelerated from 70-212mph in a little as a second, and I saw the loser
  chain of slow grocery getters disappear behind me. I was approaching 576mph in
  3rd gear, VTEC had not even kicked in yet when I saw a cop. He saw me. Time
  slowed down just like in an action movie I saw the crumbs of the pink frosted
  doughnut he was eating roll down his workman mustache before he reached down
  and shifted his pitiful sluggish inferior automatic gear lever into the 'D'
  position. Seconds later, looking behind me, he was out of sight completely
  and you'd need an 8k DSLR behind 2 telescopes and an electron microscope to
  make out the dot that was the location I was in behind me because I was already
  traveling 838mph, topped out in 4th gear. "One gear left" I thought.
  That is the story of how i beat my first ferrari.

  For a comparison, an S2000 costs MORE than a same year corvette despite having half the power, half the torque, marginally lower weight, worse handling, worse brakes, and WORSE fuel economy. Yes those wonderful Honda engineers managed to somehow pump out less than half the power from half the cylinders of a Chevy small block v8 while consuming MORE fuel. Honest to God, looking at the stoichiometry and thermodynamic conservation of energy I do not even understand how such a colossal fuck up is possible, and yet somehow those slant eyed monkeys managed it. Anyone who buys that car in the USA is an idiot. The Corvette is always the answer.
  For the last 8 months, I've been putting away $500 from every check into a savings account, and whenever I see a low-priced 240SX, I'd make an offer. I've found that 80% of advertised price usually works.
  Now, I'm not looking for mint condition 240SX's. I'm looking for "Project Cars" and "Rolling Shells". I usually get them for prices between $300-900.
  I have 6 of them right now, sitting in my backyard. Im gonna go buy another one today.
  The reason I am doing this, is I absolutely hate 240SX's. I figure every cheap piece of shit project that some fuck head highschooler has failed to turn into a "drift missile", and that I buy for ridiculously low prices, is one less 240SX on the road.
  I'm not losing too much money on this endeavor. I've been parting out every single one of them. 2 are down to almost a bare chassis (nothing but misc wiring and undesirable parts) left over.
  I'd say for every $100 I've spent, I made well over half of that back from selling parts. Haven't sold scrap yet tho, so let's see if I can get back my full investment.
  But one thing that I have never sold, no matter how much someone has offer: The actual chassis... They will never run again. They will eventually be scrapped once I run out of space in my backyard.
  I fucking hate 240sx owners. I really do. So this is my middle finger to them and their community.
  So please... Keep converting these hunks of shit into barely running shit-heaps. That's just another $700 I need to spend upfront, and another month I have to wait until I get half my cash back from parts, and buy another to start the process of all over again.
  Not everyone will get the build or appreciate it and I never expected everyone to either.
  It's an artform to me that I enjoy doing. I can say that everytime I get out of my car, I turn around and look at it with a smile ear to ear. It's not a "normal" car and I'm not a "normal" person. I don't want to be like anyone else. If I wanted 100% respect on the internet from "car people" I would get a car that everyone else has in the car scene already, throw bags on it, get "real wheels" , camber it some and call it a day.

  At the the beginning of the model year 2002, Mazda wanted to experiment with online ordering. They picked the Miata as the model for the test. For a period of about 30 days (Sept 17-Oct 15, 2001) you could go online and custom order your Miata direct from Mazda. You then had to take that build order to the Mazda dealer of your choice to finalize the deal (price. etc)

  The models and option packages were no different than what could be ordered through the dealer. But as an enticement, Mazda offered two color options ($150) that would only be available through the Custom Order Miata Program, Laser Blue Mica and Vivid Yellow. They are the same colors that were available on the Protege5 at the time.

  There were only 239 Vivid Yellows and 151 Laser Blues, (59 Cloth, 62 leather) built as a result.

  Some owners were the original COP orderer and some of us were lucky enough to buy one off the dealer lot when non-delivered units were put back in the dealer stock pool.

  It is nice that Mazda kept their word and didn't use these colors again on the NB. I know some SE people weren't happy when their SE color became a regular color the next year.

  The new Winning Blue on the NC is close but doesn't have as much magenta as Laser, it's more silvery.

  I think Vivid Yellow was used on the NB for an SE in the UK and I know that Laser Blue (Starry Blue) was a Limited Edition model in several European countries. The same Starry Blue was also used for a Limited Production Mazdaspeed NB in Japan (16" gold wheels).

  Determination is a vital component of success. So is a lack of fear when it comes to learning new things. 

  If my unsolicited opinion carries any weight, she should really pay attention to making it stop faster and turn better. 

  Stainless steel brake lines, a master cylinder brace, DOT 4 fluid, high performance brake pads and then urethane steering rack bushings, stiffer sway bars and better end links, better lateral links and better a-arms.
